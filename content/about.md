# **Hi There**

My name is Allan . I’m currently a student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology.
I love CTFs, I do almost every online CTF available on ctftime.org. My main focus is on web application security. I’m also learning reverse engineering and binary exploitation on the side.
This is my personal blog where I post writeups for challenges from time to time.
